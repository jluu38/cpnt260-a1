## Summary
This is homepage draft for a dog matchmaking site.

Because the site is currently in beta, the homepage is minimal. The goal is to appeal to a user as quickly as possible with an image and brief but informative text. While there aren't any bells and whistles, the dog serving as the logo is hopefully memorable.
